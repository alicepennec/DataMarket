We take into consideration the differences in feeling between men and women.', '      How do your boots protect you from outdoor conditions?

A membrane is a very fine component (between 5 and 25 micrometers) affixed to the inside of a fabric that will prevent water from entering while letting moisture escape.

': ' We chose a warm lining that provides insulation protecting you effectively from the cold. We tested it in the lab and in the field with representative users. We checked up to which temperature it will stay comfortable when not moving or when walking, because it can vary a lot: +36°F in static mode or no movement and 18°F in dynamic mode (movement). And we took into account how temperature is felt differently by men and women.', '      How do your boots protect you from outdoor conditions?    ': ' Your boots have been designed with a 100% waterproof mid-height inner boot to protect the part of the foot most in contact with the snow. The textile upper is water-repellent and warm to give you good protection against cold and snow.', '      How can you be sure your boots are 100% waterproof?     ': ' We made sure that your boots are waterproof by conducting laboratory tests to simulate walking with the boots half-submerged in water. We also conducted field tests to measure wear and aging. During the waterproofing test, we test 3 levels of waterproofing: 2,000 flexes (about 2.5-mile walk), 4,000 flexes (about 5-mile walk), and 8,000 flexes (about 10-mile walk). Your boots were tested to 8,000 flexes, which is equivalent to 10 miles of walking. (N.B: The upper is water-repellent)', '      What is the difference between traction and grip?    ': ' The traction of the boots depends on the number and shape of the studs. The grip is dependent on the materials of the sole and the tread pattern, like the tires of your car. Traction optimizes propulsion, prevents the boot from slipping backward when going uphill, and stabilizes the boot. Grip prevents the boot from slipping and skidding on smooth ground or in demanding conditions (rain, snow, ice) by giving grip to the sole.', '      What type of grip and traction does this boot provide?    ': ' Your boots, which are equipped with SNOWCONTACT soles, have been designed for maximum comfort in terms of grip for hiking and traction on snow. The positioning and height of the crampons (5 mm) are strategically placed for optimal grip when hiking on snow. The surface and the tread pattern of the lugs are designed to conform perfectly to hard snow surfaces and eliminate any excess water so that you do not slip.', '      How does the snowcontact technology used on the boot sole help you?     ': ' The SNOWCONTACT soles are made with a specific component and stud pattern that is designed to ensure the best possible grip and traction. SNOWCONTACT soles are more effective than traditional soles on snow. When walking on ice, the only way to ensure optimum safety is to add anti-slip grips to your boots.', '      Will your boots withstand regular use over the long term?    ': ' Our engineers conduct laboratory tests to ensure that the product fully complies with your satisfaction in use. Our verifications include the following elements: tearing eyelets and straps, gluing, toxicology, UV-resistance, abrasion-resistance of outsole and upper components, accelerated aging.', '      How to choose the right footwear for snow hiking    ': ' To be well equipped in winter, we recommend that you follow these principles: Warmth: warmth provided by a warm pair of socks (ideally containing a suitable percentage of wool)Breathability: Choose the sock according to the intensity of the hike and make sure you get a breathable model to minimize moisture.Boot height: Adjust the height of the sock to the height of the boot and preferably choose high models if you want more protection.', '      How to preserve the technical qualities of your boots?     ': "" A fabric's water-repellent property is its capacity to make water run off its surface without seeping in. This prevents the fabric from soaking up water and keeps it lightweight, warm, and breathable. The water-repellent property is achieved by treating the fabric's exterior.
